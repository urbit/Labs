# NEAR x Urbit Labs

The NEAR BOS has a thriving ecosystem of developers and an innovative method for composing frontends via components stored on the NEAR blockchain. Urbit can enhance the BOS by acting as a private server that new components can interact with, unlocking decentralized interfaces populated by personal data. To enable these new components, Urbit Labs is [forking the NEAR Social VM to add a new Urbit object with methods that wrap the @urbit/http-api library](https://github.com/urbit/create-near-app).

We're also shipping a NEAR Urbit app for browsing Urbit-native gateways. This is the repo for that appâ€”you can install the app yourself on Urbit from `~bitdeg`.
